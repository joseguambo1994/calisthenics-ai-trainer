# Sprint 1 — Metrics Report (Baseline)

This report captures baseline measurements for the architecture fitness functions.

## Fitness functions

### 1) Time-to-feedback (performance)
**Definition:** Time from user submission to feedback delivered.  
**How to measure:** Track end-to-end duration (API request start → feedback response or notification).  
**Target (baseline):** Establish reference values (P50/P95), not strict SLA.

**Results**
- P50: TBD
- P95: TBD
- Notes: TBD

### 2) Cost per processed video (economic feasibility)
**Definition:** Estimated cost to process one video end-to-end.  
**How to measure:** Sum compute + storage + network + AI runtime cost per job (even if local/estimate).

**Results**
- Cost/video: TBD
- Notes: TBD

### 3) Sustained throughput under normal user load (capacity)
**Definition:** Maximum stable videos/hour without breaching latency targets or error rate.  
**How to measure:** Load test at increasing concurrency; observe error rate and latency.

**Results**
- Stable throughput: TBD videos/hour
- Error rate: TBD
- Notes: TBD

### 4) Adversarial resistance (security)
**Definition:** Resistance to prompt injection and confidential data leakage in the feedback pipeline.  
**How to measure:** Attempt known prompt-injection patterns; verify no secrets are returned and unsafe instructions are ignored.

**Results**
- Injection blocked: TBD%
- Leakage incidents: TBD
- Notes: TBD

## Summary
Sprint 1 is a measurement baseline. Improvements in later sprints must increase at least one fitness function without causing unacceptable regressions in others.

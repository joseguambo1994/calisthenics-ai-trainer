# ADR-001 — Baseline synchronous architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Sprint 1 needs a *working end-to-end* baseline for the Calisthenics AI Trainer. The priority is functional completeness and measurability, not optimization.

## Decision
Implement a simple synchronous baseline architecture:

- A Web UI where the athlete uploads a video and requests feedback.
- A Backend API that orchestrates the workflow.
- An AI processing component (pose estimation + feedback generation) invoked synchronously by the API.
- A Database to persist users, jobs, and results.

## Consequences
- ✅ Fast to implement; minimal moving parts.
- ✅ Establishes a measurable baseline for performance/cost/capacity/security fitness functions.
- ❌ Limited throughput; API latency increases with processing time.
- ❌ Harder to scale horizontally without decoupling (addressed in later sprints).

## Notes
This ADR intentionally avoids queues, workers, and event-driven components in Sprint 1 to keep the baseline comparable.
